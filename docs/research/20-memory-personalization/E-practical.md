# Memory & Personalization — Practical & Forums

**Research value: high** — A rich, opinionated practitioner corpus across Reddit (r/ChatGPT, r/LocalLLaMA, r/LangChain), Hacker News, dev.to, and YouTube has converged on a clear architectural vocabulary (Mem0 / Zep / Letta / LangGraph Store), a clear user-facing debate (transactional vs. relationship-driven), and a clear set of failure modes (context pollution, memory bloat, prompt-injection vectors). Enough independent convergence to trust the patterns; enough controversy to map open questions.

## Executive Summary

The practitioner conversation splits into three loosely-connected sub-communities that all end up building variants of the same thing:

1. **End-users of ChatGPT memory** (r/ChatGPT, HN) oscillate between loving it (relationship-driven use: companion, habit tracking, long-running projects) and disabling it outright (transactional use: "context pollution", "memory dossier", cross-project bleed). The April 2025 "Reference chat history" rollout intensified this split and introduced a new sub-complaint: *unmanageable* memory — users can no longer see or edit what the system has inferred.
2. **Local-LLM builders** (r/LocalLLaMA) ship DIY hierarchical memory on top of SQLite + ChromaDB, usually mimicking MemGPT's three-tier architecture (short-term / working / long-term) with ~50ms latency overhead, and repeatedly hit the same four bugs: context bleeding between projects, memory bloat, tool loops when memory is exposed as an `add_memory`/`search_memory` tool, and LLMs saving trivia ("what time is it").
3. **Framework integrators** (r/LangChain, dev.to) have settled on a small set of named products — **Mem0, Zep, Letta (formerly MemGPT), LangGraph Store/Checkpointer, SuperMemory** — and produce near-identical "drop-in memory in 5 minutes" tutorials. Benchmarks (LoCoMo, LongMemEval) are starting to sort them: Zep's temporal knowledge graph currently leads on accuracy (~85%), Mem0 leads on setup speed and ecosystem maturity, Letta leads on architectural ambition but is "not production-ready."

A cross-cutting meta-pattern: almost every mature writeup ends up implementing **two agents, not one** — a primary conversational agent plus a separate *memory manager* (Christian Rice's LangGraph "Sentinel + Knowledge Master" pattern, Mem0's internal extraction LLM, Zep's async enrichment pipeline). The single-agent "just dump everything in RAG" approach is now widely viewed as obsolete.

A second cross-cutting pattern: **account-level memory is losing, project-scoped memory is winning.** HN commenters explicitly praise Anthropic's project-scoped approach over ChatGPT's global memory, and the top practitioner complaint against OpenAI's feature is architectural, not UX.

### Reddit — r/ChatGPT (end-user experience)

- **"Saved Memory Problem"** — [r/ChatGPT, 1o2pxzs](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1o2pxzs/saved_memory_problem/). Core bug: saving new memories breaks recall of old memories; deleting the newly-saved entries temporarily restores function. Workaround cluster: drop facts into the 30–50k-token context instead, back memories up to Google Docs, avoid creating new memories until OpenAI ships a fix.
- **"Built a plugin to fix ChatGPT's broken memory"** — [r/ChatGPT, 1m9bs7r](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1m9bs7r/built_a_plugin_to_fix_chatgpts_broken_memory/). Third-party patches now exist for what users perceive as a first-party regression.
- **"Chat history completely gone on desktop, anyone…"** — [r/ChatGPT, 1mdbq4y](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1mdbq4y/chat_history_completely_gone_on_desktop_anyone/). Mass-reset incidents (cross-referenced by Piunikaweb, Nov 2025) where saved memories wiped silently across desktop, mobile, and web simultaneously. OpenAI never publicly acknowledged.
- **Community-forum corollary — "ChatGPT Memory Will Not Save!"** ([community.openai.com, 1244497](https://community.openai.com/t/chatgpt-memory-will-not-save/1244497)). Many users report their memory feature stopped working post-update; one well-circulated diagnostic: enabling Developer Mode (orange chat input) silently disables memory entirely.
- **"Your Year with ChatGPT" recap threads** (Dec 2025). OpenAI's Spotify-Wrapped-style feature made memory visible in a playful way and forced users to confront what the system had stored — became a viral memory-audit event; practitioners wrote DIY prompts (`Give me a ChatGPT wrapped`) to trigger similar recaps.

### Reddit — r/LocalLLaMA / r/LocalLLM (DIY builders)

- **"finally got my local agent to remember stuff between sessions"** — [r/LocalLLaMA, 1r25chl](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1r25chl/finally_got_my_local_agent_to_remember_stuff/). Llama 3.3 70B coding assistant with human-inspired tiered memory (short-term / working / long-term), ~50ms latency overhead, "let the model decide what's memorable rather than rule-based filtering."
- **"AI Agent that can read PDFs and has memory retained across sessions — 3 files, no API keys, no cloud"** — [r/LocalLLaMA, 1r913o6](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1r913o6/ai_agent_that_can_read_pdfs_and_has_a_memory_that/). 1,244 lines, SQLite-backed `store / recall / forget` primitives; the archetypal minimalist DIY build cited across the sub.
- **"How are you handling persistent memory across local Ollama sessions?"** — [r/LocalLLaMA, 1rokrsm](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1rokrsm/how_are_you_handling_persistent_memory_across/). Pain points: context bleeding between projects; session resets forcing re-explanation.
- **"How are you handling persistent memory for AI coding agents?"** — [r/LocalLLaMA, 1r5q7xd](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1r5q7xd/how_are_you_handling_persistent_memory_for_ai/). Architecture decisions, bug fixes, and constraints lost during context compaction; pattern: hand-authored `.md` files for critical decisions + automated memory for chat-derived facts; security concern flagged — memory-injected instructions can persist across sessions ("memory as attack surface").
- **"We gave our RAG chatbot memory across sessions — here's what broke first"** — [r/LocalLLaMA, 1rqujc1](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1rqujc1/we_gave_our_rag_chatbot_memory_across_sessions/). Agentic-RAG pattern: three tools — `search_docs`, `search_memory`, `add_memory` — let the LLM decide when to retrieve vs. store. Catalogued the community's four most-cited failure modes: tool loops (fixed with a 5-call budget), user-ID hallucination (fixed by baking IDs into closures), trash memory extraction ("what time is it"), and latency explosion from multiple API round-trips.
- **"VELLE.AI — local AI companion with memory, voice, quant engine"** — [r/LocalLLM, 1r7dbwm](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLM/comments/1r7dbwm/i_built_velleai_a_local_ai_companion_with_memory/). Emblematic of the "fully-local ChatGPT-memory replacement" product category — no cloud, no subscription, SQLite-backed.

### Reddit — r/LangChain (production)

- **"how you guys are dealing with the long running agents??"** — [r/LangChain, 1rpnxmx](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1rpnxmx/how_you_guys_are_dealing_with_the_long_running/). Converges on the LangGraph two-layer model: **Checkpointer** (short-term thread state, PostgreSQL-backed) + **Store** (long-term, namespaced JSON). Consensus: both are needed — Checkpointer alone means every new thread starts fresh, Store alone causes bloat.
- **"From support chat to sales intelligence: multi-agent system with shared long-term memory"** — [r/LangChain, 1q785ld](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1q785ld/from_support_chat_to_sales_intelligence_a/). Shared-memory multi-agent architecture; treats memory as a first-class structured store of *user insights*, not raw transcripts.
- **"Langgraph state messages token limit"** — [r/LangChain, 1f7484p](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1f7484p/langgraph_state_messages_token_limit/). Maintainer-endorsed pattern: pass only last N messages to input nodes instead of the full history; widely cited recipe.
- **Needle.app — "We indexed all of r/LangChain 2025"** ([blog](https://needle.app/blog/we-indexed-r-langchain-2025-mcp)). Memory leaks / bloat in long-running agents ranked in the top-5 most-searched LangChain topics of 2025, alongside RAG optimization and multi-agent orchestration.

### Hacker News

- **"Memory and new controls for ChatGPT"** — [HN 39360724](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39360724), Feb 2024 rollout. Establishing thread. Most-upvoted framing: Pi-style user research shows **two user modes — "transactional" (every chat is a Google-like one-shot, no memory wanted) vs. "relationship-driven" (LLM as colleague/friend, memory critical)**. Commenters demand a "2-D map of contexts" and "hierarchies of context" rather than a flat global store. Identifies the now-famous `bio` tool call: `to=bio` writes arbitrary strings into a "model set context" block injected into later system prompts.
- **"OpenAI memory available for ChatGPT Plus users"** — [HN 40202977](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40202977), April 2024 broader rollout.
- **"I don't like ChatGPT's new memory dossier"** — [HN 44052246](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44052246). Top concern: **per-project isolation is missing**; the "memory dossier" leaks personal-project context into work-project replies. Quote: *"The per-project memory is a huge miss right now. I can only presume the global behavior so far is some architectural limitation."*
- **"I turned off ChatGPT's memory"** — [HN 47132001](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47132001). Canonical disable-memory manifesto. Key claims: *"When used as a tool it gives a significantly worse experience,"* memory "introduces bias and baggage from past chats," and **Anthropic's project-scoped memory is held up as the model to beat**. Concrete Claude complaints: it relates every Kubernetes question back to *"that one time I was deploying Kubernetes on VMs,"* unhelpfully.
- **"ChatGPT memory seems weird to me"** — [HN 45218761](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45218761). Users report ChatGPT knowing their company, tech stack, and personal details not visible in the memory UI — evidence that "explicit memory" is only one of two mechanisms; an embedding-based implicit memory runs alongside.
- **"Dump ChatGPT's Memory and Chat History by Inspecting the System Prompt"** — [HN 43946471](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43946471). Reverse-engineered architecture: ChatGPT maintains ~**40 recent conversations** in its system prompt under `"recent conversation content"`, storing only user messages (not assistant responses, likely as a prompt-injection mitigation), plus an "aggregated user insights" block.
- **"ChatGPT and Gemini has cross-conversation personalization"** — [HN 47163219](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47163219). Notes the cross-vendor default-setting difference: off-by-default on ChatGPT, on-by-default on Gemini.
- **"Hacker plants false memories in ChatGPT to steal user data in perpetuity"** — [Ars Technica, Sep 2024](https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/09/false-memories-planted-in-chatgpt-give-hacker-persistent-exfiltration-channel/). Security researcher **Johann Rehberger** demonstrated indirect prompt-injection-to-memory: malicious Google Drive / OneDrive docs or viewed images can write persistent false memories (user is 102 years old, lives in the Matrix) and — proof-of-concept — exfiltrate all subsequent inputs/outputs to an attacker server. OpenAI initially closed it as "safety, not security" before a partial fix.

### dev.to tutorials

- **Syed Mehrab — "Giving LLMs a Long-Term Memory: An Introduction to Mem0"** ([dev.to](https://dev.to/syed_mehrab_08fb0419feedf/giving-llms-a-long-term-memory-an-introduction-to-mem0-3jhp)). The canonical 3-liner recipe: `Memory().add(...)` / `get_all(...)`, with Mem0 framed as the "continuously updated diary" vs. RAG's "PDF reading." Explicit comparison table to Zep, Letta, LangChain Memory Modules, Redis + vector search, and raw Pinecone/Weaviate.
- **Fransys — "I Tested 5 AI Memory Tools So You Don't Have To (2026 Comparison)"** ([dev.to](https://dev.to/fransys/i-tested-5-ai-memory-tools-so-you-dont-have-to-2026-comparison-2ode)). 1-week head-to-head benchmark: **setup time** (Mem0 15m, Zep 30m, Letta 45m, SuperMemory 5m, Alma 2m); **memory accuracy** after a week (Zep 85%, Letta 82%, Mem0 78%, SuperMemory 71%); **retrieval quality** — SuperMemory over-extracts (16 false positives), Zep's entity focus is precise but misses conversational context, Letta's agent-curated memories read as summaries. Key finding: *"More memories ≠ better."*
- **Varun Pratapbhardwaj — "5 AI Agent Memory Systems Compared: Mem0, Zep, Letta, SuperMemory, SuperLocalMemory (2026 Benchmark Data)"** ([dev.to](https://www.dev.to/varun_pratapbhardwaj_b13/5-ai-agent-memory-systems-compared-mem0-zep-letta-supermemory-superlocalmemory-2026-benchmark-59p3)). LoCoMo benchmark scoreboard: **Zep ~85%, Letta/MemGPT ~83.2%, Mem0 ~66% (self-reported) / ~58% (independent)**.
- **Ana Juliabit — "Mem0 vs Zep vs LangMem vs MemoClaw: AI Agent Memory Comparison 2026"** ([dev.to](https://www.dev.to/anajuliabit/mem0-vs-zep-vs-langmem-vs-memoclaw-ai-agent-memory-comparison-2026-1l1k)). LongMemEval scores: **Zep 63.8%, Mem0 49.0%** — a 15-pt advantage attributed to temporal-graph architecture. Flags Mem0 pricing cliffs ($0 → $19 → $249/mo) and that graph memory is paywalled behind Pro.
- **Utkrshm — "Building a Voice-Controlled Local AI Agent with LangGraph and Mem0"** ([dev.to](https://dev.to/utkrshm/building-a-voice-controlled-local-ai-agent-with-langgraph-and-mem0-2421)). The "4-layer build" recipe: (1) dumb pipeline, (2) agent StateGraph, (3) memory (LangGraph `MemorySaver` for within-session + Mem0 for cross-session), (4) TUI. Explicit separation of *short-term* (session, `MemorySaver`) vs. *long-term* (cross-session, Mem0). Includes the now-common HITL pattern: `interrupt()` before write operations, resumed from checkpoint.
- **focused.io — "Persistent Agent Memory in LangGraph"** ([dev.to](https://dev.to/focused_dot_io/persistent-agent-memory-in-langgraph-1c4a)). Canonical LangGraph reference for **Checkpointer vs. Store**; flags memory-bloat as the #1 production failure mode.
- **Mem0 official — "How to Build Context-Aware Chatbots with Memory using Mem0"** ([dev.to](http://dev.to/mem0/how-to-build-context-aware-chatbots-with-memory-using-mem0-io)). Vendor tutorial; cited token-reduction numbers ("90% lower token usage, 91% faster responses").
- **Ragavis — "RAG Tutorial 2026: Build AI Chatbot with LangChain & ChromaDB"** ([dev.to](https://dev.to/ragavis-techjournali/rag-tutorial-2026-build-ai-chatbot-with-langchain-chromadb-step-by-step-guide-2hi)). Entry-level onboarding; treats memory as a special case of RAG.

### YouTube how-tos

- **Adam Lucek — "Building Brain-Like Memory for AI | LLM Agent Memory Systems"** (Dec 2024, 43:31, 48.3K views, 1.9K likes; [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKPngyO0iKg)). The reference video for the **four-memory cognitive architecture** — working (reingested transcript) / episodic (prior conversations + reflections) / semantic (RAG over factual corpus) / procedural (persistent instructions file + model weights). Inspired by Sumers et al.'s *Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents* ([arXiv:2309.02427](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02427)) and MemGPT. Ships code repo using Weaviate + hybrid search + Lang­Graph. Standalone finding: procedural memory is modelled as an auto-updated 10-rule takeaways file continuously refined by a reflection pass.
- **Christian Rice / "Deploying AI" — "Build an Agent with Long-Term, Personalized Memory"** (22:53, 42.1K views; [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPCKB9MUP6c)). Re-implements ChatGPT's memory feature in LangGraph with a **two-agent architecture**: a cheap "Memory Sentinel" first decides whether a message contains anything new; if yes, a GPT-4 "Knowledge Master" uses parallel tool calling to `create / update / delete` typed memories (allergies, likes, dislikes, attributes). Explicit about *categories* — allergies are sacred, likes/dislikes are disposable.
- **Sam Witteveen — "LangChain — Conversations with Memory"** ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X550Zbz_ROE)). The legacy reference for `ConversationBufferMemory`, `ConversationSummaryMemory`, `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory` — still widely linked as the "basics" primer.
- **"The Next Wave" / Matt Wolfe + Nathan Lands — "Latest ChatGPT Updates Explained: Memory, o3 & o4-mini, 4.1"** ([thenextwave.show](https://www.thenextwave.show/latest-chatgpt-updates-explained-memory-o3-04-mini-41-social-media-rumors/)). Mass-audience explainer covering the April 2025 "Reference chat history" rollout.

### Engineering blog posts / newsletters

- **Denis Kisina — "Building AI Agents That Actually Remember: A Deep Dive into LangGraph + Mem0"** ([deniskisina.dev](https://deniskisina.dev/building-ai-agents-with-memory-langgraph-mem0/)). End-to-end social-media-manager agent with Mem0's hierarchical scoping (user / session / agent).
- **mem0.ai — "Build an Agentic RAG Chatbot With Memory Using LangGraph and Mem0"** ([mem0.ai/blog](https://mem0.ai/blog/agentic-rag-chatbot-with-memory)). Codifies the "agent chooses which tool (doc search vs. memory search vs. memory store)" pattern that r/LocalLLaMA's 1rqujc1 thread described in community-driven terms.
- **Calvin Ku — "From Beta to Battle-Tested: Picking Between Letta, Mem0 & Zep for AI Memory"** ([Medium](https://medium.com/asymptotic-spaghetti-integration/from-beta-to-battle-tested-picking-between-letta-mem0-zep-for-ai-memory-6850ca8703d1)). "Letta is community-driven but not production-ready; neither Letta nor Zep felt quite ready for production stress tests compared to Mem0."
- **Letta forum — "Agent memory: Letta vs Mem0 vs Zep vs Cognee"** ([forum.letta.com/t/88](https://forum.letta.com/t/agent-memory-letta-vs-mem0-vs-zep-vs-cognee/88)). Cognee enters as a fourth contender (knowledge-graph-centric); the vendor-neutral voice of this thread is unusual and valuable.

### Twitter/X & secondary press

- **Tom's Guide — "This pro tip makes ChatGPT remember you"** ([link](https://tomsguide.com/ai/chatgpt/this-chatgpt-memory-hack-changes-everything-use-these-prompts-to-make-it-remember-you)). Mass-audience variant of the `Remember that I prefer X` pattern, packaged as a "60-second game-changer."
- **Ars Technica — "ChatGPT can now remember and reference all your previous chats"** ([link](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/chatgpt-can-now-remember-and-reference-all-your-previous-chats/)). April 2025 "Reference Chat History" launch coverage; explicitly notes EU/UK/EEA exclusion and that *"unlike the older memory feature, information saved via chat history cannot be accessed or modified — it's either enabled or disabled."*
- X/Twitter signal was **thin** — no single viral memory thread surfaced the way `@mkbijaksana`'s anti-slop thread did for humanization prompts. Most X content on ChatGPT memory is one-off "60-second hack" posts rather than durable technical threads.

## Key Techniques / Patterns

- **The two-agent memory pattern.** A cheap filter ("does this turn contain anything memorable? true/false") gates a more expensive extractor that writes typed facts with `create/update/delete` actions. Used by Christian Rice's LangGraph demo, internally by Mem0, and implicitly by Zep's async enrichment pipeline.
- **Tiered memory (MemGPT-style).** Short-term queue + working context + long-term archival + recall store. Copied wholesale by the r/LocalLLaMA "Llama 3.3 70B" thread (~50ms overhead) and by Letta as a product.
- **Four-type cognitive memory.** Working / episodic / semantic / procedural, from [Sumers et al. 2023 (arXiv:2309.02427)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02427). Popularized in practitioner circles by Adam Lucek's YouTube tutorial and the LangChain blog; now the default mental model in tutorials.
- **LangGraph: Checkpointer + Store.** Checkpointer = thread-scoped short-term state (typed schema, PostgreSQL-backed); Store = namespaced long-term memory (JSON documents per user). Memory-bloat in Store is the top cited production bug.
- **Agentic memory tools.** Expose `search_memory(query)` and `add_memory(fact, category)` as LLM-callable tools; let the model decide. Known pathologies: tool loops (fix: 5-call budget per turn), wrong user-IDs (fix: bake IDs into tool closures), trash extraction (fix: system-prompt guidance on *what counts* as memorable).
- **Hybrid SQLite + vector store (DIY).** SQLite for structured episodic facts (timestamped key/value, user-id-scoped) + ChromaDB/Weaviate/Qdrant for semantic similarity. The standard r/LocalLLaMA architecture.
- **Temporal knowledge graphs.** Zep's central bet: store entities, relationships, *and validity intervals* so "user moved from NY to Tokyo" is handled as a state change, not two conflicting facts. Scores ~63.8% on LongMemEval vs. Mem0's ~49%.
- **Explicit `bio` / "remember that…" triggers.** ChatGPT's `to=bio` tool is the UX primitive users interact with when they say `Remember that I'm a vegetarian`. Community tip: saying "Remember that…" is more reliable than hoping the extractor catches it implicitly.
- **Custom Instructions vs. Memory division of labor.** Custom Instructions hold permanent identity (profession, tone, format preferences); Memory holds evolving detail (current project, allergies, opinions). Widely recommended and user-tested. Suggested length cap: ~1,500 words of custom instructions.
- **Temporary Chat as escape hatch.** Users treat ChatGPT's Temporary Chat mode as their "incognito" — no memory creation, no memory retrieval — and use it for sensitive or exploratory queries.
- **Project-scoped memory (Anthropic pattern).** Claude Projects bucket memory per-workspace; the community-expressed preference over ChatGPT's account-global approach.
- **Secondary reflection pass.** After each session, run a reflection LLM that produces: context tags, conversation summary, what-worked, what-to-avoid. The "episodic memory with reflection" recipe (Adam Lucek); also implicit in Voyager's skill library.
- **Procedural memory as an auto-edited prompt file.** A persistent `.md` / `.txt` of "10 ongoing rules" that a reflection pass continuously edits; treated as the system's *own* learned style guide. Analogous to Cursor's `.cursor/rules` or the Claude `CLAUDE.md` convention.
- **Human-in-the-loop gates.** LangGraph's `interrupt()` pauses the graph before memory-write / file-write actions; the user confirms and execution resumes from the checkpoint. Heavily used in local builds because memory-writes are harder to undo than chat messages.
- **Memory extraction prompts with categories.** Rather than freeform facts, extractors output typed records: `{category: "allergy|like|dislike|attribute", knowledge: "...", action: "create|update|delete", old_knowledge: "..."}`. Categories enable downstream per-agent filtering ("the meal-planning agent always loads allergies but skips likes").

## Notable Quotes

> "I've done a bunch of user interviews… there are two common usage patterns: 'Transactional' where every chat is a separate question, sort of like a Google search… and 'Relationship-driven' where people chat with the LLM as if it's a friend or colleague. In this case, memory is critical." — HN commenter, [39360724](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39360724)

You know, I don't care if last week you had too many tacos and you don't want to eat tacos this week — that's not something that needs to persist. You know, the fact that you like tacos, that is something that is interesting." — Christian Rice, *Deploying AI* YouTube

## Emerging Trends

- **Account-level memory is a consensus miss; project-scoped is winning.** HN and r/ChatGPT complaints cluster around cross-project bleed; Anthropic's Claude Projects and ChatGPT's "Memories inside Projects" feature are the fix. Product-direction signal: vendors are retrofitting scoping on top of global memory rather than the other way around.
- **Agentic memory replacing buffer memory.** `ConversationBufferMemory` / `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory` are now treated as legacy; the modern pattern is tools (`search_memory`, `add_memory`, `search_docs`) the LLM chooses between, optionally fronted by a cheap extractor agent.
- **Memory as a benchmarked category.** LoCoMo, LongMemEval, and independent week-long tests are now standard; Zep's temporal-graph architecture holds a double-digit lead on most benchmarks, shifting the conversation from "does it work?" to "what does 85% accuracy mean for my use case?"
- **The four-memory mental model is going mainstream.** Working / episodic / semantic / procedural is now the default vocabulary in dev.to and YouTube tutorials. Procedural memory as an auto-edited rules file is the most novel of the four in practitioner hands.
- **The "memory dossier" backlash.** April 2025 "Reference Chat History" rollout created a distinct sub-community of users who explicitly disable memory and use ChatGPT logged-out or in Temporary Chat. The framing has hardened from "privacy concern" to "product defect."
- **Memory as attack surface.** Rehberger's false-memory prompt injection is now the canonical security story; indirect-injection-via-memory is showing up as a threat-model item in enterprise/open-source agent frameworks.
- **SQLite + vector store as the DIY default.** Across r/LocalLLaMA, the pattern has stabilized: SQLite for structured facts + ChromaDB/Qdrant for semantic retrieval, often with a 3-file agent in <1.5k lines as the reference implementation.
- **Commoditized memory layers.** Mem0, Zep, Letta, SuperMemory, LangMem, Cognee, MemoClaw, RetainDB, PersistMemory — the category has gone from 1 product (Letta/MemGPT) in 2023 to double-digits in 2026, with consolidation pressure ($24M Mem0 raise, open-source alternatives like SuperLocalMemory).
- **Two-agent architecture as default.** Almost every mature writeup now separates the conversational agent from a memory manager (Sentinel+KnowledgeMaster, Mem0 extractor, Zep async enricher). The "let the main LLM manage its own memory" approach (pure Letta-style) is gaining interest but losing on cost and reliability.
- **HITL on memory writes.** LangGraph's `interrupt()` pattern for confirming memory writes is spreading; treats the memory store more like a database migration than a chat side-effect.
- **Year-in-review as forced memory audit.** "Your Year with ChatGPT" (Dec 2025) accidentally became the most effective memory-audit UX the space has yet produced — users finally *saw* their aggregated insights and reacted, often by editing or wiping memory.

## Open Questions / Gaps

- **Forgetting and consolidation strategies.** Almost no practitioner writeup describes explicit decay, TTLs, or memory compression beyond "ask the LLM to summarize." Zep's temporal-graph and Letta's paging are exceptions; the rest of the field has a hoarding problem.
- **Memory evaluation is fragmented.** LoCoMo, LongMemEval, vendor-run week-long tests — none are standardized enough for cross-vendor numbers to be trusted. Independent Mem0 scores (~58%) are materially lower than self-reported (~66%).
- **Cross-model / cross-vendor portability.** None of the major memory layers has a real portability story (export your Mem0 memories into Zep, or your Claude Projects memories into ChatGPT). Vendor lock-in is becoming the implicit strategy.
- **Privacy-preserving memory.** On-device memory (Alma, VELLE, local SQLite builds) exists but is isolated from the cloud-API ecosystem. Federated / encrypted memory is effectively unexplored in practitioner corpus.
- **Memory editing UX.** The top user complaint about ChatGPT memory in 2025 is that "Reference chat history" content is unreadable and uneditable. Product design space is wide open — no one has shipped a "memory editor" that non-technical users actually use.
- **How much memory is the right amount?** Fransys' finding ("more memories ≠ better") is widely cited but there is no published Pareto curve of memory count vs. accuracy vs. retrieval latency.
- **Memory security in the agent-tool setting.** Rehberger's attack shows the risk; no practitioner writeup describes concrete defenses beyond "user messages only, not assistant outputs," which is a partial mitigation at best.
- **Multi-user / multi-tenant memory in shared agents.** Production teams cite cross-user contamination as a live risk (user-ID hallucination, shared namespace bugs) but the fix ("bake IDs into tool closures") is a workaround, not an architecture.
- **The relationship between memory and personalization as humanization.** Almost no one in this corpus frames memory as a *humanization* mechanism (the agent sounds more like a real colleague *because* it remembers). The discussion stays stubbornly operational — facts recalled, tokens saved — rather than interpersonal. This is a major conceptual gap the Humanizer project can fill.
- **Sycophancy vs. memory interaction.** If an agent remembers "user likes feature X," does that increase sycophantic agreement in future turns? No one has studied it.
- **Prompt-engineering for the memory extractor itself.** The "Sentinel prompt" and category schema are load-bearing, but tutorials treat them as one-off engineering, not a reusable artifact.
